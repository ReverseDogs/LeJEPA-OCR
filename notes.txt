Label the 50M Labelled OCR Pairs with the HunyuanOCR model from Hugging Face https://huggingface.co/tencent/HunyuanOCR
The HunyuanOCR model could also be used for evaluation. 

Critical Fixes Needed:

❌ Fix SIGReg DDP synchronization (will break multi-GPU)
❌ Fix prediction loss (use centering, not naive MSE)
❌ Add Phase 2→3 transition strategy (handle distribution shift)
⚠️ Start with 10K-100K samples, not 200M
⚠️ Leverage training loss for model selection (no labels needed!)
